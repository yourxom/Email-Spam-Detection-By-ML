📧 Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing and classification algorithms. This project 

demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

🚀 Features
Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Multiple classification models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

Confusion matrix visualization

Visualizations: Confusion matrix and bar charts for metric comparison
